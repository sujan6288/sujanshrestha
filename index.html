            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The educational system in Nepal was long based
                on home-schooling and gurukulas.[1] This was similar to the former
                Indian system of education, in which the pupils would learn either
                in their homes or with reputed priests or Gurus. Before Nepal was
                declared a democratic country, the general public had no access
                to formal education. The first formal school, Durbar High School, established
                by Jung Bahadur Rana in 1853, was intended for the elite. The birth of
                Nepalese democracy in 1951 opened its classrooms to a more diverse
                population.[1] Education in Nepal from the primary school to the
                university level has been modeled from the very inception on the Indian
                system, which is in turn the legacy of the old British Raj.[2]</p>
